# BillSplitUp

Bill Splitup is a MERN project built to reduce the efforts of different bill split related calculations. In our model any user can add a trip and can divide the total amount of trip among n users. In each trip added the user will be able to add amount paid by each user and his/her details. A final result will be shown to the users about which person owes how much to the other person with his/her name and amount to be given to the other person. In our model the user will also be able to view previous trips split-up incurred.
